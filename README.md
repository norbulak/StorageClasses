# Storage Classes in C demonstrations

This project is meant to accompany the **medium** article I've published on **Storage Classes** in the C programming language available here *(it's free)*: 
As you already know if you read my article, there are four different storage classes. 




# Usage

In order to run the different demonstrations (one for each storage class) you need to change the MACRO `DEMONSTRATION` to one of the following
```
AUTO
STATIC
REGISTER
EXTERN
```

Thanks for your support.
